# cogpilotdatachallenge

This repository contains the submission notebook and helperfunctions file for the [cogpilot data challenge](http://pilotperformance.mit.edu/cogpilot-data-challenge-20-description) hosted by the US Department of the Air Force - MIT Artificial Intelligence (AI) Accelerator.

There are 2 tasks for this challenge, and our submission focuses on Task 1. Task 1 requires us to classify the difficulty level (1-4) of a flight simulation run using only physiological metrics. This task will be evaluated using F1 score and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to assess classification accuracy between predicted and actual difficulty level.
